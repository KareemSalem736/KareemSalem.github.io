        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          With a B.S. in Computer Science and years of hands-on experience in secure communications, I bring a unique perspective to software engineering. 
          My time in the U.S. Air Force honed my ability to manage mission-critical data and collaborate under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of service, I’ve continued to grow through self-driven learning and real-world projects — from designing secure password generators to optimizing SQL databases. 
          I thrive on building efficient, scalable, and secure systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently preparing for a SkillBridge opportunity in June 2025, where I aim to transition into a full-time Software Engineer role and contribute to innovative teams solving meaningful problems.
